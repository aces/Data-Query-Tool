		<H3>Help: Define Filters</H3>
		<p>Filters can be applied on any field in order to limit the set of results returned by a query, e.g. to extract data collected only at one specific site, or from a particular visit.</p> 
		<p>The "Define Filters" tab is organized like "<a href="DefineFields.html">Define Fields</a>", where data fields are grouped per instrument or category. Select a category, then click on a field of interest to add it to the list of Selected Filters at bottom.
		<br>
		Finally, in the Selected Filters panel, define the filter criteria on that field via the "Operator"  and "Value" columns. More than one filter may be added to a query.  Multiple filters will be applied using 'and' logic.
		<br>
 		The operators are as follows:
			<ul>
        		<li>= equal to</li>
        		<li>!= does not equal</li>
        		<li><= less than</li>
        		<li>>= greater than</li>
        		<li>startsWith: filter for values starting with a specific character or string</li>
        		<li>contains: filter for values containing a specific character or string</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
