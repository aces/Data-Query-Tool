        <H3>Help: Define Fields</H3>
        <p>To define fields for a query, begin by selecting a category of data fields from the "Choose category" dropdown. All field names and field descriptions from that category will appear in a table below. The number of fields displayed per page can be modified in the top left corner of this table.  Any results exceeding this display limit will be displayed on subsequent pages within the table, accessible via buttons labelled First, Previous, Next and Last, visible in the lower right corner after scrolling to the bottom of the field display table.</p>
        <p>To add a field to your query, click anywhere in the field row to highlight the field and add it to the list of "Selected Fields" at bottom.</p>
        <p>To remove a selected field from a query, click in the highlighted field row in the list of all fields, or click on its "Remove" button in the Selected Fields table.</p>
        <p>If all fields from a particular category should be included in the query, use the "Add all" button next to the "Choose category" dropdown to select all fields.  Click "Remove all" to remove all fields in this category from the query.</p>
        <p>Once all desired fields are listed under "Selected Fields", continue to the "<a href="DefinePopulation.html">Define Filters</a>" tab to add filters to your query, or go directly to the "<a href="ViewData.html">View Data</a>" tab.</p>
