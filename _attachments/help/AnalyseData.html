        <p>The Statistical Analysis tab provides basic aggregate statistics on the query output dataset.</p>
        <p>Click the "Calculate Statistics" button to generate statistics on the results of the most recently executed query (via View Data tab).</p>
        <p>Under the Basic Statistics section, a table will display calculated values such as Min, Max, Standard Deviation, Mean, and more, on all values returned for each selected field from the query.</p>
        <p>The number of rows (fields) displayed can be modified, and additional rows can be displayed by clicking on "Previous" and "Next" links at the bottom right corner of the table</p>
        <p>Clicking on any row in the Basic Statistics table will generate a histogram graph representing the data, which will be displayed under the "Histogram of Numeric Columns" header. Note that any fields not represented in numeric format (coded "NaN") will not generate results in this graph.</p>
